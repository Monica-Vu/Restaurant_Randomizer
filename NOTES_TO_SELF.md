# Frontend
## React Fragments 
* React Fragments allow you to return multiple elements from a React component by allowing you to group a list of children without adding an extra DOM element
* If possible, try to use a fragment as `div` elements require more resources -> causes pages to slow down & harder to debug. Fragments have a smaller dom -> renders fast and allows multiple JSX components to be return, which addresses the issue of having invalid HTML markups
* You could also use `<></>`
